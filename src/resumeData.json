    "bio":"Hi, I'm Andrew and I am a current undergraduate student of the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Sciences studying Computer Science. I would consider myself an inquisitive technologist, a resourceful researcher, and a result-oriented worker.  Outside of my academia, I find myself participating in many programming opportunities, including hackathons, and also research on emerging technologies.  I hope to utilize the knowledge I have into a career in software engineering and data analytics.   My personality is bright and given the opportunity, I enjoy getting to know and work with like-minded individuals.  I work well independently with minimum supervision and am also able to excel in group projects. ",
